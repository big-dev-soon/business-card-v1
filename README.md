# Task
Your task is to create your own Business Card Website with HTML and CSS as presented in design under the Business Card project section in BigDevSoon. Dive into Frontend development and produce a very first, yet beautiful website that could serve as your professional Developer's Portfolio! ðŸ¤—

## Prerequisites
You can choose any technologies of your own preference, the same applies to any tools, libraries, frameworks and everything related. We want you to have fun building this project and composing a technology stack that plays well with your taste.

## Requirements

- [ ] The website looks similar to the design and is implemented as a Desktop version.
- [ ] The website looks similar to the design and is implemented as a Mobile version.
- [ ] Icons should be clickable and redirect users to external pages in a new tab.
- [ ] Users can click on the email and the default email client will open.
- [ ] Users can click on the phone and it'll start the call. (on the Mobile version).
- [ ] Add some animations, we recommend a Fade In animation for example. (when the website is first loaded).
- [ ] A bit more advanced: add skeleton animation for the image while it's loading. ðŸ‘€
- [ ] Add anything else that you'd like to see in your own Business Card, some more icons, skills, go crazy! ðŸŽ‰

## Deployment
Once you are ready with the project and unlocked the Complete step, you can try deploying the project to Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. One important thing to remember is that we've added a `<bds />` tag to the `index.html` file and will do a check against it while trying to add a Project URL. Don't forget it! ðŸ˜Š
